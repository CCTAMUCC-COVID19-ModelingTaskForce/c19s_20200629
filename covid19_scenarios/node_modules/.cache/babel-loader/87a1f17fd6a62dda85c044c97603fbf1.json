This large step size results in inaccuracies, in particular\nas we are using first order integration scheme. This step size is now reduced to 0.05 days. This can change the output\nof the model by a few percent. We will soon move to a higher order integration scheme for more accurate ODE integration.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`2020-03-26: Modification of the model to allow for more realistic latency distributions`}</h3>\n    <p>{`In this update, we replaced the single exposed category with a sequence of three exposed categories. The single category\nimplicitly assumes that individuals spend an exponentially distributed time in the \"exposed but not yet infectious\"\nstate. The peak of the exponential distribution is at zero implying that many individuals spend a very short time in\nthis category while others spend a much longer time. In reality, it will take at least 2-3 days before the virus has\ngrown to sufficient numbers before somebody is infectious.
