For example, if you want to show a loading indicator for at least 1 second (but longer if needed) to prevent a confusing flash in the UI.\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install p-min-delay\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst pMinDelay = require('p-min-delay');\n\n(async () => {\n\tconst value = await pMinDelay(somePromise, 1000);\n\t// Executed after minimum 1 second even if `somePromise` fulfills before that\n})();\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### pMinDelay(promise, minimumDelay, [options])\n\n#### promise\n\nType: `Promise`\n\nPromise to delay.\n\n#### minimumDelay\n\nType: `number`\n\nTime in milliseconds.\n\n#### options\n\nType: `Object`\n\n##### delayRejection\n\nType: `boolean`<br>\nDefault: `true`\n\nDelay the rejection.\n\nTurn this off if you want a rejected promise to fail fast.\n\n\n## Related\n\n- [delay](https://github.com/sindresorhus/delay) - Delay a promise a specified amount of time\n- [p-immediate](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-immediate) - Returns a promise resolved in the next event loop - think `setImmediate()`\n- [p-timeout](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-timeout) - Timeout a promise after a specified amount of time\n- [More…](https://github.com/sindresorhus/promise-fun)\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n",
