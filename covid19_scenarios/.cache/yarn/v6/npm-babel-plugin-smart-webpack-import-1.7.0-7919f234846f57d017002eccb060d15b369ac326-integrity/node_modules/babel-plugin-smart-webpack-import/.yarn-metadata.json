It keeps Webpack's Magic Comments and \"Pure\" markers for Uglify compression. You can pass it over to your Babel config like this:\n\n```js\nimport { shouldPrintComment } from \"babel-plugin-smart-webpack-imports\"\n\nexport default {\n  presets: [...],\n  plugins: [...],\n  shouldPrintComment\n}\n```\n\nPlease not that this only works in a JS environment e.g. an exported Rollup or Webpack config. A plain `.babelrc` is not capable of declaring functions or even importing code. With Babel v7 your can use a `.babelrc.js` file as well.\n\n## License\n\n[Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](license)\n\n## Copyright\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/sebastian-software/sebastian-software-brand/0d4ec9d6/sebastiansoftware-en.svg\" alt=\"Logo of Sebastian Software GmbH, Mainz, Germany\" width=\"460\" height=\"160\"/>\n\nCopyright 2018-2019<br/>[Sebastian Software GmbH](http://www.sebastian-software.de)\n",
