That worker constructor works just fine without bundling turned on, but when bundled the result is **supported in all browsers** that support Web Workers - all the way back to IE 10!\n\nWorkers with fully dynamic URLs, Blob URLs, data URLs or with no `{ type:'module' }` option are left unchanged.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install -D worker-plugin\n```\n\nThen drop it into your **webpack.config.js:**\n\n```diff\n+ const WorkerPlugin = require('worker-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  <...>\n  plugins: [\n+    new WorkerPlugin()\n  ]\n  <...>\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n**worker.js**: _(our worker module)_\n\n```js\n// This is a module worker, so we can use imports (in the browser too!)\nimport { calculatePi } from './some-other-module';\n\naddEventListener('message', event => {\n  postMessage(calculatePi(event.data));\n});\n```\n\n**main.js**: _(our demo, on the main thread)_\n\n```js\nconst piWorker = new Worker('./worker.js', { type: 'module' });\npiWorker.onmessage = event => {\n  console.log('pi: ' + event.data);\n};\npiWorker.postMessage(42);\n```\n\n> **Note:** in order to ensure WorkerPlugin bundles your worker, make sure you're passing a **string** URL/filename to the Worker constructor. WorkerPlugin cannot bundle workers with dynamic/variable filenames, Blob or data URLs - it will leave them unmodified and print a warning during your build.\n\n## Options\n\nIn most cases, no options are necessary to use WorkerPlugin.\n\n### `globalObject` _(string | false)_\n\nWorkerPlugin will print a warning if your Webpack configuration has `output.globalObject` set to `window`, since doing so breaks Hot Module Replacement in web workers.\n\nIf you're not using HMR and want to disable this warning, pass `globalObject:false`:\n\n```js\nnew WorkerPlugin({\n  // disable warnings about \"window\" breaking HMR:\n  globalObject: false\n})\n```\n\nTo configure the value of `output.globalObject` for WorkerPlugin's internal Webpack Compiler, set `globalObject` to any String:\n\n```js\nnew WorkerPlugin({\n  // use \"self\" as the global object when receiving hot updates.\n  globalObject: 'self' // <-- this is the default value\n})\n```\n\n### `plugins` _(array)_\n\nBy default, WorkerPlugin doesn't run any of your configured Webpack plugins when bundling worker code - this avoids running things like `html-webpack-plugin` twice. For cases where it's necessary to apply a plugin to Worker code, use the `plugins` option.\n\nHere you can specify the names of plugins to \"copy\" from your existing Webpack configuration, or provide specific plugins to apply only to worker code:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  <...>\n  plugins: [\n    // an example of a plugin already being used:\n    new SomeExistingPlugin({ <...> }),\n\n    new WorkerPlugin({\n      plugins: [\n        // A string here will copy the named plugin from your configuration:\n        'SomeExistingPlugin',\n        \n        // Or you can specify a plugin directly, only applied to Worker code:\n        new SomePluginToApplyOnlyToWorkers({ <...> })\n      ]\n    })\n  ]\n  <...>\n}\n```\n\n### `sharedWorker` _(boolean)_\n\nIf set to `true`, this option enables the bundling of [SharedWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker):\n\n```js\nconst shared = new SharedWorker('./my-shared-worker.js', { type: 'module' });\n```\n\n### `worker` _(boolean)_\n\nIf set to `false`, this option disables the bundling of [Worker]. Intended to be used with `{ sharedWorker: true }` to allow bundling of [SharedWorker] only without also bundling [Worker].\n\n### `preserveTypeModule` _(boolean)_\n### `workerType` _(string)_\n\nNormally, WorkerPlugin will transform `new Worker('./a.js', { type: 'module' })` to completely remove the `type` option, outputting something like `new Worker('a.worker.js')`. This allows the plugin to compile Module Workers to Classic Workers, which are supported in all browsers.\n\nTo instead retain `{type:'module'}` in bundled output, set the `preserveTypeModule` option to `true`:\n\n```js\n  plugins: [\n    new WorkerPlugin({\n      preserveTypeModule: true\n    })\n  ]\n```\n\nSimilarly, if you need to have WorkerPlugin output a specific `type` value, use the `workerType` option to spefify it:\n\n```js\n  plugins: [\n    new WorkerPlugin({\n      workerType: 'foo'  // note: this isn't a thing!\n    })\n  ]\n```\n\n## Loader\n\nAt its core, worker-plugin provides two features: parsing and handling of `new Worker()`, and standalone bundling of modules for use in a different JavaScript context.\n\nIf all you want is to compile separate bundles for a module, `worker-plugin/loader` provides the bundling functionality of worker-plugin as a standalone Webpack loader. This is useful for generating bundles for use in iframes, Service Workers or Worklets. Applying `worker-plugin/loader` to an import will bundle that module and return its URL:\n\n```js\nimport workerUrl from 'worker-plugin/loader!./my-worker';\n\nconsole.log(workerUrl); // \"/0.worker.js\"\n\nCSS.paintWorklet.addModule(workerUrl);\n```\n\nTwo options are available:\n\n| Option | Type | Description\n|---|---|:--|\n| `name` | _string_ | Controls the name of the generated chunk.<br>The name is used to generate a URL according to  `output.chunkFilename`.\n| `esModule` | _boolean_ | Export the URL from an ES Module (`export default url`).<br>The default is CommonJS (`module.exports = url`).\n\nOptions can be supplied inline:\n\n```js\nimport url from 'worker-plugin/loader?name=foo&esModule!./foo';\n```\n\n... or by setting up a loader alias:\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js to enable this:\n// import url from 'worker!./foo';\n{\n  resolveLoader: {\n    alias: {\n      worker: 'worker-plugin/loader?esModule'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## License\n\nApache-2.0\n",
