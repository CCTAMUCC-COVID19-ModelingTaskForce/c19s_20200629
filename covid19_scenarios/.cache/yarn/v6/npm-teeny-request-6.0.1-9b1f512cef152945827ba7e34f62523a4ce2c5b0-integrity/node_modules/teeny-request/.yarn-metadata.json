Uses `node-fetch` under the hood. \nPop it in where you would use `request`. Improves load and parse time of modules. \n\n```js\nconst request = require('teeny-request').teenyRequest;\n\nrequest({uri: 'http://ip.jsontest.com/'}, function (error, response, body) {\n  console.log('error:', error); // Print the error if one occurred\n  console.log('statusCode:', response && response.statusCode); // Print the response status code if a response was received\n  console.log('body:', body); // Print the JSON.\n});\n```\n\nFor TypeScript, you can use `@types/request`. \n\n```ts\nimport {teenyRequest as request} from 'teeny-request';\nimport r as * from 'request'; // Only for type declarations\n\nrequest({uri: 'http://ip.jsontest.com/'}, (error: any, response: r.Response, body: any) => {\n  console.log('error:', error); // Print the error if one occurred\n  console.log('statusCode:', response && response.statusCode); // Print the response status code if a response was received\n  console.log('body:', body); // Print the JSON.\n});\n```\n\n\n\n## teenyRequest(options, callback)\n\nOptions are limited to the following \n\n* uri\n* method, default GET\n* headers\n* json\n* qs\n* useQuerystring\n* timeout in ms\n* gzip\n* proxy\n\n```ts\nrequest({uri:'http://service.com/upload', method:'POST', json: {key:'value'}}, function(err,httpResponse,body){ /* ... */ })\n```\n\nThe callback argument gets 3 arguments:\n\n * An error when applicable (usually from http.ClientRequest object)\n * An response object with statusCode, a statusMessage, and a body\n * The third is the response body (JSON object)\n\n## defaults(options)\n\nSet default options for every `teenyRequest` call.\n\n```ts\nlet defaultRequest = teenyRequest.defaults({timeout: 60000});\n      defaultRequest({uri: 'http://ip.jsontest.com/'}, function (error, response, body) {\n            assert.ifError(error);\n            assert.strictEqual(response.statusCode, 200);\n            console.log(body.ip);\n            assert.notEqual(body.ip, null);\n            \n            done();\n        });\n```        \n\n## Proxy environment variables\nIf environment variables `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` are set, they are respected. `NO_PROXY` is currently not implemented.\n\n## Building with Webpack 4+\nSince 4.0.0, Webpack uses `javascript/esm` for `.mjs` files which handles ESM more strictly compared to `javascript/auto`. If you get the error `Can't import the named export 'PassThrough' from non EcmaScript module`, please add the following to your Webpack config:\n\n```js\n{\n    test: /\\.mjs$/,\n    type: 'javascript/auto',\n},\n```\n\n## Motivation\n`request` has a ton of options and features and is accordingly large. Requiering a module incurs load and parse time. For\n`request`, that is around 600ms.\n\n![Load time of request measured with require-so-slow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101553/44694187-20357700-aa3a-11e8-9116-b8ae794cbc27.png)\n\n`teeny-request` doesn't have any of the bells and whistles that `request` has, but is so much faster to load. If startup time is an issue and you don't need much beyong a basic GET and POST, you can use `teeny-request`.\n\n## Thanks\nSpecial thanks to [billyjacobson](https://github.com/billyjacobson) for suggesting the name. Please report all bugs to them. Just kidding. Please open issues.\n",
